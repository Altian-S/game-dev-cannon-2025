<h2 style="text-align: center;">An Interview With Flubbus</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">With Flubbus</h4><br><br>
<h4>Transcribed</h4>
<a style="text-align: center">So, uhh Mr Flubbus? Mrs Flubbus?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">Just Flubbus is fine, no need to complicate things</a><br>
<a style="text-align: center">Okay then, lets get this started. What are your thoughts on people who accuse you of running a cult?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">Yeah. I do, does anyone have a problem with that?</a><br>
<a>Well I mean I'm sure alot of people do have a problem with that. Calling yourself a cult is concerning to the locals, did you know housing prices near your facility have plummeted do to your "activities"</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">What's wrong with our woodworking course, we're putting carpentry back into the hands of the people. Do you have a problem with that Mr <i style="background-color: black; color: black">Nothing Here</i>?</a>
<a>The woodworking course is not what I-other's are concerned about, it's the people eating chairs, don't you think that's a little, I dont know, Ridiculous and possibly dangerous?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">No, I dont believe people eating chairs is inherently wrong, we don't force this on anyone, just because people are participating in our ritual doesn't make it wrong and no matter what people will slap label's like "Cult" on practically anything nowadays.</a><br>
<a>Aren't you worried someoes going to hurt themselves oneday eating a chair? What happen's when someone dies in your facility? </a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">What happen's when someone dies at work. What happen's when someone dies in school, you know what happen's, the government investigates it, rule's whether the death was intentional or not and we do or don't get prosicuted, and so far we have had 0 death's if thats what you're asking.</a><br>
<a>There's an alarming amount of children focusing on filbism nowaday's, why do you target your advertising campaign's towards children?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">I'm sorry I thought this interview was gonna be more centered around my life rather than these accusitory falsehoods?</a><br>
<a>Are you to afraid to answer the question?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">No, I'm not. Are most recent venture has been into social media and in doing so we have attracted a younger audience, it's not like we do it on purpose, the idea of someone eating a chair is just and entertaining one and I'm sure half the people currently interested wont join, but that other half might, and that's more important.</a><br>
<a>So you're willing to target children in order to gain more traction?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">Name me one person who hasn't, we dont go after kids, doesnt mean we havent but our target demographic is anyo-</a><br>
<a>-anyone desperate enough?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">No, anyone willing enough to join, we are just trying to help people out of dark place's, it's up to them whether or not they want to stay.</a><br>
<a>I see... How about yourself, I hear you aren't the creator of Filbism? How did you fall into it?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">Yes, I am not the creator of Filbism but I like to think ive helped others reach the light. It all started when i was around seventeen, eighteen-ish and I saw a video of a man eating a chair, at first I thougt it was some weird fetish stuff but I did more research on it and there I found Filbus.</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">It was kind of magical, he was everything I would ever want to be, he was originally a kids show host but they canceled him because of some problems with advertisers, after that he spent his life trying to spread filbism and then people started picking it up online, and that's when i decided to continue his legacy. </a><br>
<a>So you dont have any proof of filbism?</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">Sure, you could say I have no proof all of the people who have participated in Filbism have no proof. We dont need complete concrete proof, we follow his teachings to be with Filbus.</a><br>
<a>And so you eat chair's for Filbus... How does that corelate at all to his teachings.</a><br>
<a style="color: firebrick">Have you not... are you stupid?</a>
