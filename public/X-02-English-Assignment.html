<details><summary><b style="color: darkgrey">History On Filbism</b></summary>
<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, monospace; color: crimson">Filbism is a religion made from our leader Filbus<br>
<img width="150" src="placeholder"><br>
One of the main fundamentals of Filbism is the creation and consumption of chairs in honor of "Filbus's great Sacrifice"<br>
    We now celebrate Filbus through the consumption of chairs and in return he gives us gifts of healthier digestion and good luck<br>
    All media containing Filbus and Filbism must be used as an advertisement<br>
    <br>
    Fun Fact!<br>
    Filbus used to have an animated series where he starred as himself and gave helpful lessons about chairs to children. the program was shut down when the filbism advertisements advanced beyond 5 per minute of TV runtime.<br>

<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, monospace; color: crimson">Flubbus started his journey with Filbism when he saw a video of a man eating a chair, Flubbus was starstruck by the sight,
eventually he dedicated himself to filbism and teaches the gospel of filbism.<br>
<br>
Flubbus teaches the art of making a proper chair, his hands have started to fuse with his tools showing his dedication to the cause... although it has made his daily life alot harder<br>
<br>
Flubbus prides himself in his work often going to hospitals and schools to help <b style="text-decoration-line: line-through; background-color: black; color: ghostwhite">convert</b> educate the youth of today. Many students say <p style="text-decoration: underline; color: crimson">"I have no idea who this Filbus guy is but I love his Values... my stomach does kinda hurt"</p> Aswell as <p style="text-decoration: underline; color: crimson">"I never thought that Id eat a chair... But it does feel nice being included in something bigger than myself."</p><br><br>
<img width="150" src="placeholder"><br>
    <p style="color: crimson">Flubbus legs have become more like chair legs than anything, apparently he's starting to grow new ones out of his hips. He's taking quite a liking to the style Filbus had wearing dark black clothing and a hat, although the hat is slightly bigger.</p>

<details><summary><b style="color: darkgray">The Deniers</b></summary>
<p style="font-family: --apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, monospace; color: crimson">There are those who deny the benefits of Filbism and even some against Flubbus calling him a "False Preacher" and "Only after my chair"<br>
<br>
    These <b style="background-color: firebrick; color:  black">LIARS</b> are only after <b style="background-color: firebrick; color:  black">FAME</b> trying to trick the general public, one of these deniars Jim '<b style="background-color: firebrick; color:  black">DEVIL</b>' davis is someone who tries to <b style="background-color: firebrick; color:  black">BAN</b> the consumption of chairs<br> 
<br><img src="placeholder" width="120" alt="JIM DAVIS">
    
<br>
Jim Davis is a deniar, claiming "Filbism isnt even a real religion, all you do is eat chairs.". His clear lack of understanding the culture and history of Filbism is revolting. His current campaign against Filbism involves trying to ban the advertisments of eating chairs, completely flying in the face of religous freedom.<br>
<br>Flubbus responds to each claim by eating another chair, this act of sacrifice often baffles and confuses his opponents,"you shouldnt eat chairs! that could kill you!". Clearly not understanding the gifts Filbism gives.
