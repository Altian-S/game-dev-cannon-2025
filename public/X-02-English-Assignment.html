<details><summary>History On Filbism</summary>
Filbism is a religion made from our leader Filbus<br>
<img width="150" src="placeholder"><br>
One of the main fundamentals of Filbism is the creation and consumption of chairs in honor of "Filbus's great Sacrifice"<br>
    We now celebrate Filbus through the consumption of chairs and in return he gives us gifts of healthier digestion and good luck<br>
    All media containing Filbus and Filbism must be used as an advertisement<br>
    <br>
    Fun Fact!<br>
    Filbus used to have an animated series where he starred as himself and gave helpful lessons about chairs to children. the program was shut down when the filbism advertisements advanced beyond 5 per minute of TV runtime.<br>
