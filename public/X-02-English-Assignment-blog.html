HELLO, I AM FLUBBUS THIS IS MY BLOG<a style="font-size: xx-small">02/09/21</a><br><br><hr style="background-color: black">
I ate another chair<a style="font-size: xx-small">03/09/21</a><br><hr>
Found another follower. We were talking about which chair we prefer, this freak likes metal chair's.<a style="font-size: xx-small">025/10/21</a><br><hr>
Found a sofa chair, it's taking awhile to eat. A random man approached me and he asked why I was eating a sofa, I told him about filbism and he gave me a funny look, look whos laughing now<a style="font-size: xx-small">30/10/21</a><br><hr>
Its the spooky day, when people dress up like idols, monsters or themselve's. It's a nice day, people dont judge me, a day I feel normal.<a style="font-size: xx-small">31/10/21</a><br><hr>
THE FAT MAN BROUGHT ME COAL AGAIN. It CANNOT be that HARD to give me a WOODEN CHAIR, I haven't done ANYTHING WRONG no violence, no biting NOT EVEN ANY VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER and still I get punished, believe me he will be killed.<a style="font-size: xx-small">25/12/21</a><br><hr>
The new year is here and now its time to make new goal's, I realised the world is lacking filbism, lacking truth and I think I need to be the one to change that. I'm starting tommorow.<a style="font-size: xx-small">31/12/21</a><br><hr>
I got into contact with the follower I met in fall, although I disagree in his selection of chair's he still is a follower of Filbism and he is the first to join the church of flubbus(might change name later kinda lame)<a style="font-size: xx-small">2/01/22</a><br><hr>
We've grown in size again, its a little unexpected but a welcome change. I might start a website, probably on geocities or something.<a style="font-size: xx-small">26/01/22</a><br>
i have learned something horrible about geocities<a style="font-size: xx-small">27/01/22</a><br><hr>
One of our followers has offered to make a website! It looks a little dated but I'm just happy we have one, he's getting an extra chair for sure!<a style="font-size: xx-small">12/02/22</a><br><hr>
Thing's are progressing so quickly, we've already got a fully functioning website, a woodworking class and respect from a few of the townspeople. We're getting donation's, we never set up a donation bin but people keep giving us money... its getting concerning<a style="font-size: xx-small">23/04/22</a><br><hr>
We've got enough money to buy an old plot of land, the house on it is falling apart but I think we can pull it together, everyone seems so excited about this. I don't think ive ever been so happy.<a style="font-size: xx-small">4/06/22</a><br><hr>
The construction is complete, it's suprising what people can do when we work together we built a woodworking room, prayer room and a few shared living spaces. Honestly I didn't think it would go this far. In Filbus we trust.<a style="font-size: xx-small">23/07/22</a><br><hr>
People have started to complain. The neighbours think we're some sort of cult and I can understand why, we tried explaining it was no different to christianity but they refuse to listen. Hopefully this will go away.<a style="font-size: xx-small">2/08/22</a><br><hr>
We've reached about a 100 members! This is such a monumentous occasion, alot of people joining all at once it looks like things are going up. Although I'm hearing word of this "Jim" fellow, seems like trouble.<a style="font-size: xx-small">28/10/22</a><br><hr>
