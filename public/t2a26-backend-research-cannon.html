List the backends you have researched here.<br><br>
Replit - AI HOGWASH, alot of the options cost money and i dont think it does enough warranting me to pay instead of going to another platform like render
<br>Render - Pretty good, free options are stable and quick enough to do testing, the one mr ellis taught.
<br>Railway - They lied to me, i need to link up my debit/credit card
List the backends you have tried here <br><br>
<br>Render, its the only one I put effort into trying, it has a readable user interface, setup was fairly simple and its able to handle most server types all condensed into a free package, allows you to have multiple backend servers for free at the same time, but it is not open 24/7.
Conclusion Here<br><br>
If you need a server to run long periods of time then you should probably seek out other options than render, Railway seems like a good option, cheaper server prices (as of typing this) and a fairly large information load, along with a 5 dollar budget each month. Replit seems to be aligning itself with people vibecoding, offering ai packages to develop apps and while it isnt my thing I understand people seeking that option out so to each their own.
